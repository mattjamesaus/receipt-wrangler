# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Receipt Wrangler Mobile is a Flutter mobile application that provides a native interface for Receipt Wrangler, a receipt management and splitting system. The app enables users to manage receipts on the go with camera/gallery uploads, receipt scanning, group management, and receipt splitting capabilities.

## Development Commands

### Core Flutter Commands
- `flutter run` - Run the app on connected device/emulator
- `flutter build apk` - Build Android APK
- `flutter build ios` - Build iOS app
- `flutter test` - Run unit tests
- `flutter analyze` - Analyze Dart code for issues
- `dart format .` - Format Dart code
- `flutter clean` - Clean build artifacts
- `flutter pub get` - Install dependencies
- `flutter pub upgrade` - Upgrade dependencies

### API Client
The project uses a generated OpenAPI client located in the `api/` directory. The client is imported as a local package dependency in pubspec.yaml.

## Architecture Overview

### State Management
The app uses Provider pattern with ChangeNotifier models:
- **AuthModel**: Authentication state, JWT tokens, API client configuration
- **GroupModel**: Group management and selection
- **ReceiptModel**: Receipt data, form state, and image handling
- **UserModel**: User profile and preferences
- **CategoryModel**, **TagModel**: Metadata management
- **SearchModel**: Search functionality with RxDart streams
- **PermissionsModel**: The caller's effective permissions, used for UI gating (see "Permission-based UI gating")

### Navigation
Uses `go_router` with nested shell routes:
- **Group Selection Shell**: `/groups` with group selection UI
- **Group Context Shell**: `/groups/:groupId/*` with group-specific navigation
- **Search Shell**: `/search` with search interface
- Individual routes for receipt forms, viewing, and editing

The receipt form routes (`/receipts/:receiptId/{view,edit}` and the comments variants) use
`pageBuilder` with `NoTransitionPage(key: state.pageKey, ...)` instead of `builder`. During a
default transition the outgoing and incoming `ReceiptFormScreen`s coexist for the animation, and
both attach the same global `receiptFormKey` — a GlobalKey collision that corrupts the form. The
`NoTransitionPage` makes the swap atomic; `key: state.pageKey` forces a fresh element per
navigation so the new screen re-fetches rather than reusing the old element. Because the swap
removes the old page in the same frame, popup-menu items that navigate must capture the router
and defer the `go` until the menu finishes dismissing (see
`receipt_app_bar_action_builder.dart`'s `_goAfterMenu`).

### Core Directory Structure
- `lib/models/` - Provider-based state management models
- `lib/auth/` - Authentication screens and logic  
- `lib/groups/` - Group management, dashboards, receipts
- `lib/receipts/` - Receipt forms, viewing, image handling
- `lib/search/` - Search functionality
- `lib/reports/` - Reports slice: list / preview / generate / delete saved report templates
- `lib/shared/` - Reusable widgets and utilities
- `lib/client/` - OpenAPI client wrapper
- `lib/utils/` - Utility functions for auth, currency, dates, etc.

### Key Features
- **Receipt Management**: Create, edit, view receipts with items and images
- **Image Handling**: Camera/gallery upload with scanning capabilities
- **Group Management**: Multi-user groups with role-based access
- **Search**: Full-text search across receipts
- **Offline Support**: Secure token storage with refresh token flow

### Form Handling
Uses `flutter_form_builder` for complex forms with validation. Receipt forms support:
- Dynamic item lists with custom fields
- Image carousel with infinite scroll
- Category and tag selection
- Currency formatting and validation

### API Integration
- Generated OpenAPI client from backend specification
- JWT-based authentication with automatic token refresh
- Centralized client configuration in `OpenApiClient` singleton
- Secure token storage using `flutter_secure_storage`

### Permission-based UI gating

The mobile app gates UI on the caller's **effective permissions**, mirroring the desktop client
(`desktop/CLAUDE.md` → "Permission-based UI gating") and the backend's enforcement (`api/CLAUDE.md` →
"Roles & Permissions"). The JWT no longer carries any role field — effective permissions are
delivered on `AppData` and are a UI hint; the server re-checks real permissions on every request, so
a stale action at worst returns 403.

- **Delivery & hydration:** permissions arrive on `AppData` (`appPermissions`, and `groupPermissions`
  keyed by group id) and are stored in **`PermissionsModel`** (`lib/models/permissions_model.dart`)
  via `setPermissions`, called **only** from `storeAppData` (`lib/utils/auth.dart`) on login and
  app-init. Token-only refreshes never touch it. The `FutureBuilder` in `main.dart` blocks first
  paint until app-init completes, so permissions are present before any gated widget builds.
- **Per-group category/tag catalogs:** `AppData` also delivers `groupCategories` / `groupTags` (keyed
  by group id), each filtered to the caller's group-role grants (the full pool when unrestricted).
  `storeAppData` indexes them into `CategoryModel` / `TagModel` (`setGroupCategories` /
  `setGroupTags`); the receipt-form pickers (`category_select_field.dart` / `tag_select_field.dart`,
  passed the receipt's `groupId`) source options via `categoriesForGroup(groupId)` /
  `tagsForGroup(groupId)`. **Do not** source the pickers from the flat `categories` / `tags` arrays —
  those are admin-only (populated only for holders of `app.categories.read` / `app.tags.read`), so a
  normal user would see an empty picker. Mirrors desktop's per-group AppData catalog selectors.
- **Matcher:** `lib/utils/permission_matcher.dart` (`permissionMatches` / `hasAll` / `hasAny`) is a
  faithful port of the backend matcher (`api/internal/permissions/matcher.go`) and its desktop twin
  (`desktop/src/utils/permission.utils.ts`), wildcard semantics included, so UI gating === backend.
- **Effective permissions are plain STRINGS on the wire, deliberately not the `Permission` enum.**
  In `swagger.yml`, `AppData.appPermissions` is an **array of raw wire strings** and
  `AppData.groupPermissions` is a **map of group id → array of raw wire strings** (`BuiltList<String>`
  / `BuiltMap<String, BuiltList<String>>` in the generated client). `PermissionsModel` ingests and
  stores those raw strings; the **query** methods still take the `Permission` enum for call-site type
  safety, converting it to its wire string via `permissionWireName`. This split is load-bearing, not
  cosmetic:
  - `Permission` is a built_value `EnumClass` whose `_$valueOf` ends in
    `default: throw ArgumentError(name)`. An unknown value fails the **entire** `AppData`
    deserialization, and since permissions hydrate on login that **hard-fails login** — the request
    returns HTTP 200 and the user sees a generic red "An error occurred". It shipped **twice**:
    2026-07-24 (`group.members.create`) and 2026-08-06 (`group.members.grants.update`, PR #661).
    Both times the released binary simply predated a backend permission addition.
  - The enum is the **catalog** ("which permissions exist" — `Role.permissions`,
    `UpsertRoleCommand.permissions`, `PermissionDescriptor.key`); the effective list is **data**
    ("which permissions this user holds"), which is server-authoritative and open-ended.
  - A granted entry may be a **wildcard** (`group.receipts.*`), which the matcher supports and the
    enum could never represent.
  - Guarded by `api/internal/permissions/registry_test.go` →
    `TestAppDataEffectivePermissionsAreUntypedStrings` (fails if the `$ref` comes back) and
    `test/models/app_data_permission_ingest_test.dart` (deserializes a payload carrying an unknown
    permission key through the real generated serializer).
  - **General lesson:** adding a value to *any* enum on a response model is a breaking change for
    already-released mobile builds. Effective-permission-style payloads should not use closed enums.
- **Checks** (`PermissionsModel`): `hasAppPermission(p)`, `hasAnyAppPermission([..])`,
  `hasGroupPermission(groupId, p, {orApp})` — the group one applies the `orApp` app-scoped override
  first (the backend `OrAppPermissions` admin-not-a-member pattern) — and
  `hasGroupPermissionInAnyGroup(p)` for screens with no single current group.
- **Gating pattern:** read `Provider.of<PermissionsModel>(context, listen: false)` and conditionally
  render, referencing the generated `Permission` constants. Most gating is **widget-level**, but a
  couple of permission-scoped routes also have **go_router redirects** (see "Route redirects" below) —
  a `redirect:` callback reads the same `PermissionsModel` from the provider tree (the router is built
  under the app's `MultiProvider`, exactly like the existing `/receipts/add` redirect), so the check
  is identical to the widget-level one.
- **Current widget gates:**
  - `canEditReceipt(permissionsModel, groupId)` (`lib/shared/functions/permissions.dart`) →
    `group.receipts.update`, used by the receipt-edit popup (`receipt_edit_popup_menu.dart`) and the
    receipt swipe-to-edit (`receipt_list_item.dart`).
  - `canCommentCreate` / `canCommentDelete` (same file) → `group.comments.create` /
    `group.comments.delete`, scoped to the receipt's group. The comment-input bottom sheet
    (`receipt_comment_screen.dart`) is hidden without create; the swipe-to-delete
    (`receipt_comments.dart`) is disabled without delete (only in **edit** state — add-state comment
    removal is a local model edit with no API call, so it stays enabled).
  - Activity rerun (`group_activity_list_item.dart`) → `group.activities.rerun`. Covered by a widget
    test (`test/widgets/group_activity_list_item_test.dart`) only — there is **no e2e** for it because
    a failed activity's `canBeRestarted` backend state isn't deterministically seedable from the API.
  - The add menu (`show_add_menu.dart`) shows "Add Manual Receipt" on `group.receipts.create` and
    "Quick Scan" on `group.receipts.quick-scan` — per-group when inside a group, or "held in any
    group" on the group-select / all-groups view, where there is no single current group.
  - The **Search** bottom-nav destination (`group_bottom_nav.dart`, `group_select_bottom_nav.dart`) is
    shown only on `app.receipts.search`. It is the **trailing** destination in both navs, so gating it
    out doesn't shift the other indices and the `switch`/`setIndexSelected` logic is unchanged.
  - The **Reports** avatar-menu entry (`top_app_bar.dart`'s `getUserAvatar`) is shown only when the
    caller holds `app.reports.read` **or** `app.reports.readAll` (`hasAnyAppPermission`), mirroring
    desktop's `canViewReports` sidebar gate. Base and `*All` are unrelated matcher keys, so the two are
    always OR-ed. The avatar is shared by both app bars, so this exposes Reports from every screen. See
    "Reporting (mobile slice)" below.
- **Route redirects** (`lib/guards/permission-guard.dart`, mirroring the desktop route guards; wired
  in `main.dart`'s `_buildAppRouter`):
  - `groupDashboardReadRedirect` on `/groups/:groupId/dashboards` → redirects to that group's
    `/receipts` when the caller lacks `group.dashboards.read` for the route's group (mirrors desktop's
    `groupDashboardReadGuard`). Group selection always lands on the dashboards route, so this covers
    both group entry and the Dashboards tab tap; the Dashboards tab itself stays visible (redirect-only,
    matching desktop).
  - `receiptsSearchRedirect` on `/search` → bounces deep links to the originating group's `/receipts`
    (or `/groups`) when the caller lacks `app.receipts.search`. Defense-in-depth behind the hidden
    search buttons; it also runs before the search shell's `state.extra as Map` cast.
  - `reportsReadRedirect` on `/reports` → bounces deep links to `/groups` when the caller lacks
    `app.reports.read` / `app.reports.readAll`. Defense-in-depth behind the hidden Reports menu entry.
- **403 handling (`lib/interceptors/auth_interceptor.dart`):** the backend returns **403 for both** an
  expired session and a permission denial (it never sends 401), so the interceptor distinguishes them
  by **token validity** (mirroring desktop's `http-interceptor.ts`): a 403 with a still-valid token is
  a permission denial and is surfaced untouched — **no token refresh, no logout** (refreshing can't
  grant a missing permission, and force-refreshing would burn the one-time refresh token / risk a
  logout). Only an expired/invalid token triggers a refresh + retry. Token freshness is otherwise kept
  current proactively (the 15-min timer in `main.dart` and the auth guard on navigation). **Paid-by
  visibility** rides on this: a group role limited to "their own receipts" gets a server-filtered
  receipts list, and any stray 403 on a hidden receipt is surfaced without disturbing the session.

### Reporting (mobile slice)

A **read/preview/generate/delete** slice of the desktop reporting feature, reachable from the avatar
menu (`lib/reports/`). Authoring is intentionally **out of scope** — there is no builder and no
create/edit/duplicate/config-view; the mobile app only lists saved report templates, previews one,
downloads (generates) one, and deletes one. The desktop client (`desktop/src/reports/`) and the Go
`/report/*` API are the source of truth; this mirrors desktop's behavior and — critically — its
permission model exactly.

- **Entry + route:** the gated avatar-menu "Reports" item (above) pushes `/reports`
  (`ReportListScreen`, a standalone `ScreenWrapper` route next to `/profile`), guarded by
  `reportsReadRedirect`.
- **List** (`report_list.dart` → `PagedDataList`): `POST /report/template/list` via
  `getReportApi().getReportTemplates`, sorted `updated_at desc` (matching desktop; the backend
  allow-lists `name`/`created_at`/`updated_at`). Rows unwrap `PagedDataDataInner.anyOf.values`
  (a `Map<int, Object?>`) by **type** — `.values.whereType<ReportTemplate>()` — not a brittle fixed
  index.
- **Per-row actions are gated ONLY on the server-computed `ReportTemplate.allowedActions`**
  (`read`→Preview eye, `generate`→Generate, `delete`→Delete), never AND-ed with a client permission
  check — `allowedActions` already bakes in the base/`*All` report permissions, the per-group ceiling,
  and the per-template grant matrix (`report_list_item.dart`, mirroring the desktop list). Deletion
  confirms via `report_delete_dialog.dart` then `DELETE /report/template/{id}`.
- **Preview = HTML, not PDF** (`report_preview_screen.dart`): desktop has no PDF preview — its preview
  is a live, row-capped **HTML** sample. `POST /report/preview` (with the template's stored
  `configuration`) returns `{ html, receiptCount }`, rendered in a **WebView**
  (`WebViewController.loadHtmlString`, JS disabled — the sample is self-contained, no network). Can
  403 if a covered group lacks `group.reports.read`; handled with a snackbar, no logout.
- **Generate = the template's saved formats** (`report_actions.dart`): `POST
  /report/template/{id}/generate` returns `Response<Uint8List>` (a single file, or a **ZIP** when the
  template has multiple formats). Bytes are written to `getTemporaryDirectory()` and handed to the OS
  **share / "Save to Files"** sheet via `SharePlus.instance.share(ShareParams(files: [XFile(...)]))`.
  The filename is a port of desktop's `reportFilename` (`report_filename.dart`): sanitized name +
  `.zip` for multi-format else `.<format>`.
- **Packages added for this slice:** `webview_flutter` (HTML preview — Android system WebView, needs
  `INTERNET` which is already declared, minSdk 24 which `flutter.minSdkVersion` already satisfies; iOS
  WKWebView, no `Info.plist`/`NSUsageDescription` for `loadHtmlString`), `path_provider` (temp file),
  `share_plus` (share sheet — auto-merges its own Android `FileProvider`, no manifest change). **None
  add a privacy-sensitive OS permission or purpose string**, and each ships its own iOS
  `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` (auto-processed under Flutter's dynamic framework linking). The app still has
  no app-level `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` — a pre-existing gap (`shared_preferences`/UserDefaults already
  qualifies), out of scope here.
- **Serialization contract (`aggFunc` omitempty):** the mobile list unwraps each `PagedDataDataInner`
  by **type** (`item.anyOf.values.values.whereType<ReportTemplate>()`, `report_list.dart`), so a
  `ReportTemplate` that fails to deserialize silently collapses to a blank row (the `one_of`
  `AnyOfSerializer` swallows per-type errors). The generated `ReportColumnAggFuncEnum` **throws on an
  empty string**, so the Go `ReportColumn` fields (`aggFunc`/`label`/`field`/`measure`/`expr`) are
  `json:",omitempty"` (`api/internal/commands/report_request_command.go`) — a dimension column must not
  emit `"aggFunc":""`. **Keep this omitempty on the API side; any future generated-client regen must
  keep the enum tolerant / the field omitted**, or every real report (dimension/formula columns) shows
  invisible rows in the mobile list.
- **Dashboard report widget (view-only):** the fifth dashboard widget type, `REPORT`, ported from
  desktop's `desktop/src/dashboard/report-widget/`. `lib/groups/widgets/dashboard_widgets/report_widget.dart`
  pins a saved template (reads `configuration.reportTemplateId` from the widget's untyped config blob),
  asks the server to render the **full dataset** (`POST /report/template/{id}/render` →
  `renderReportTemplate` → `ReportPreviewResponse { html, receiptCount, allowedActions }`), and drops the
  self-contained HTML into a **WebView** — the same rendering path as `report_preview_screen.dart` (JS
  disabled, spinner cleared on `onPageFinished`). A revoked/deleted template returns restricted-notice HTML
  at 200 with empty `allowedActions`, so there is no client "restricted" branch. Wired into the widget-type
  `switch` in `group_dashboard.dart` (bounded by the shared `SizedBox(height: widgetHeight)` so the report
  scrolls inside the tile). The **Download** button is gated **only** on the render response's
  `allowedActions.contains('generate')` (never AND-ed with a client permission — same contract as
  `report_list_item.dart`); on tap it fetches the template then reuses the existing
  `generateAndSaveReport` share helper, mirroring desktop's `downloadTemplateById` (get template →
  generate). Authoring stays desktop-only. This required a **mobile client regen** to pick up
  `WidgetType.REPORT`, `renderReportTemplate`, and `allowedActions` on `ReportPreviewResponse` — **no
  swagger change** was needed (the spec already carried all three; the mobile client was simply stale).
- **Tests:** `test/widgets/report_list_item_test.dart` (the `allowedActions` row-gating contract),
  `test/widgets/report_widget_test.dart` (the dashboard widget's pure `reportTemplateIdFromConfig`
  extraction + `reportWidgetCanDownload` gate — the WebView render path is not widget-testable, matching
  `report_preview_screen.dart`), `test/widgets/top_app_bar_reports_menu_test.dart` (menu-entry gate),
  `test/reports/report_filename_test.dart` (filename derivation), and `reportsReadRedirect` cases in
  `test/guards/permission_guard_test.dart`.
  Shared builders in `test/helpers/report_test_helpers.dart`. **E2E:** `integration_test/reports_list_test.dart`
  drives the list view — seeds a template via the new `createReportTemplate` fixture and asserts the row
  renders (the omitempty regression guard), the empty state, and the avatar-menu gate; the
  `provisionUserWithAppPermissions` fixture (inverse of `provisionUserWithoutAppPermission`) grants
  `app.reports.read`/`readAll`. Preview/generate/delete are out of the e2e scope.
  `integration_test/report_dashboard_widget_test.dart` drives the **dashboard report widget** end-to-end:
  it provisions a user (`app.reports.read`/`readAll`/`generate`/`generateAll` + Legacy Owner group), seeds
  a template, then seeds a dashboard holding a `REPORT` widget via the new `createDashboard` fixture
  (**with the fixture user's own jwt** — `getDashboardsForUserByGroup` filters on `user_id`, so an
  admin-owned dashboard would be invisible to the viewer), enters the group, and asserts the `ReportWidget`
  mounts, the WebView renders (success branch, no error placeholder, spinner clears), and the server-gated
  Download button shows. Three `testWidgets` share a `seedAndOpenReportDashboard` helper — the positive path
  plus two **deny** cases that pin down the widget's rejection contract (the render endpoint never 403s; a
  denied caller gets restricted-notice HTML at 200 with empty `allowedActions`, so denial shows up as the
  Download button being withheld, never an error): (a) a user with `app.reports.read` but **not** generate →
  the report still renders but the Download button is `findsNothing`; (b) a Legacy Viewer with no
  `app.reports.*` and no `group.reports.read` → the restricted-notice HTML renders gracefully with no
  Download. **iOS/Android only** (`skip: Platform.isLinux`) — `webview_flutter` has no Linux desktop
  implementation, so the Linux `run-e2e.sh` runner can't mount the widget.

## Development Notes

### Flutter SDK Setup (Claude Code Environment)

When working in the Claude Code environment, Flutter may not be pre-installed. To install the latest Flutter SDK on Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
# Prereqs. curl/git/pkg-config/xz-utils are usually already present; the rest
# are required for Linux desktop builds (needed for integration_test runs).
apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
  unzip zip clang lld llvm cmake ninja-build libgtk-3-dev

# Download and extract Flutter SDK. Check the current stable version at
# https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra_release/releases/releases_linux.json
# (the `current_release.stable` field names the hash; find its `version`).
cd /tmp && rm -rf flutter && \
curl -fL https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra_release/releases/stable/linux/flutter_linux_3.41.7-stable.tar.xz -o flutter.tar.xz && \
tar xf flutter.tar.xz && rm flutter.tar.xz

# Fix git "dubious ownership" warning, add to PATH persistently, disable analytics.
git config --global --add safe.directory /tmp/flutter
grep -q '/tmp/flutter/bin' /root/.bashrc || echo 'export PATH="/tmp/flutter/bin:$PATH"' >> /root/.bashrc
export PATH="/tmp/flutter/bin:$PATH"
flutter config --no-analytics

# Verify and enable Linux desktop target (needed for ./run-e2e.sh).
flutter --version
flutter config --enable-linux-desktop
flutter devices  # should list "Linux (desktop)"
```

After installing Flutter, standard commands work from `mobile/`:
```bash
cd /app/mobile
flutter pub get      # Install dependencies
flutter analyze      # Check for errors (recommended before building)
flutter test         # Run unit/widget tests
./run-e2e.sh         # Run integration tests on Linux desktop (see E2E Testing below)
flutter build apk    # Build Android APK (requires Android SDK — not installed by default)
```

**Note:** The base environment does not include the Android SDK or Chrome, so `flutter build apk` and web targets will not work without additional setup. Linux desktop + `flutter analyze` + `flutter test` + integration_test are fully supported.

### Regenerating API Client Models

After regenerating the API client with `generate-client.sh`, you need to run build_runner to generate the `.g.dart` files:

```bash
cd /home/user/receipt-wrangler/mobile/api
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

**Known dart-dio default-value regressions (re-patch after every regen).** The `dart-dio`
generator emits invalid `_defaults` initializers for some fields, which `build_runner` then can't
compile (and it deletes the matching `.g.dart` first, so the package stops building). After
regenerating, restore these hand-fixes (precedent: commits `fad192a0`, `a2ec7479`):

- `model/user_preferences.dart` — `..quickScanDefaultStatus = 'OPEN'` →
  `..quickScanDefaultStatus = ReceiptStatus.OPEN`.
- `model/system_settings.dart` — `..currencyDisplay = '$'` → `..currencyDisplay = r'$'` (a bare `$`
  in a non-raw string is invalid Dart).

`model/claims.dart` **no longer** needs a `userRole` patch — the role rework dropped `userRole` from
the swagger, so `Claims` carries only identity claims and the field is gone from the generated model.

Run `flutter analyze` after a regen; these surface as compile errors. (Hand-editing generated files
is otherwise forbidden — these are the documented exception.)

### Quick Scan field configuration

The Quick Scan per-image form (`lib/receipts/widgets/quick_scan_form.dart`) respects the selected
group's quick-scan config on `GroupReceiptSettings` — the
`quickScan{PaidBy,Status,Categories,Tags,Comment}{Enabled,Required}` fields (mirrored from the
API/desktop; see `api/CLAUDE.md` → "Quick Scan Field Configuration"). Every field renders per its
`*Enabled` flag, but only paid-by, status and comment get a `required()` **validator** (when shown
**and** `*Required`); Categories/Tags carry no field validator — their requiredness is checked at
submit in `quick_scan.dart` (see the `quick_scan_form_test.dart` note below). Categories/Tags
reuse the shared `CategorySelectField` / `TagSelectField`, sourced from the per-group catalogs, and the
comment is a multi-line `FormBuilderTextField` (`name: "comment"`, `maxLength: 500` matching the
backend's `models.MaxCommentLength`). Because the
backend **backfills** a default for a hidden/optional paid-by or status, `_submitQuickScan`
(`lib/shared/functions/quick_scan.dart`) sends the "unset" sentinel (`0` / `ReceiptStatus.empty`) for
those and per-file comma-joined `categoryIds` / `tagIds` plus a per-file `comments` string, building
**one aligned array entry per image** (never skipping, so `files` and the parallel arrays stay 1:1). It
requires a field only when that group's config marks it shown+required, mirroring the backend's
`resolveQuickScanFields`. Null settings (no group selected yet) fall back to the backend defaults:
paid-by/status shown, categories/tags/comment hidden.

The show/require derivation for all five fields lives in **one** pure helper —
`resolveQuickScanFieldConfig(GroupReceiptSettings?, {required bool canCreateComments})` →
`QuickScanFieldConfig` (`lib/shared/functions/quick_scan_field_config.dart`) — reused by both the
form's `build()` and `_submitQuickScan`, so the two can't drift from each other or from
`resolveQuickScanFields`. Covered by `test/shared/functions/quick_scan_field_config_test.dart`.

**The comment field is gated on `group.comments.create` as well as the group config.** The permission
is a **required named argument** to the resolver (not read from a provider) so the helper stays pure
and both call sites are forced at compile time to supply it; each passes the existing
`canCommentCreate(permissionsModel, groupId)` from `lib/shared/functions/permissions.dart`. Without
the permission the field is hidden **and not required** — a member who cannot comment must never be
locked out of quick scan by a comment they can't fill (the backend skips the check for them too, and
silently drops a comment sent anyway). `hideComments` on the group overrides the toggle the same way.
So **`QuickScanForm` now needs a `PermissionsModel` in its provider tree** — a widget test that omits
it throws `ProviderNotFoundException`.

`QuickScanForm.onFormChangeCallback` takes a **record** (`QuickScanFormValues`), not positional
arguments: the list opened with two `int?`s and only grows, so naming each value keeps the carousel
callback (`lib/receipts/widgets/quick_scan.dart`) from transposing them. Note the comment is
deliberately **not** cleared when the group changes (unlike paid-by/categories/tags, it isn't
group-scoped data, and the submit re-resolves visibility per group so a hidden one is never sent).

**Category/Tag picker needs a fallback context in Quick Scan.** `CategorySelectField` /
`TagSelectField` open their multi-select via `showMultiselectBottomSheet(...)`, which calls
`Navigator.of(context)`. They must resolve that context through
`ContextModel.resolveSheetContext(context)` (prefers the mounted shell context, else the field's own
context) — **not** the raw `ContextModel.shellContext`. The shell context is only set by
`receipt_form_screen.dart`; the Quick Scan flow opens straight from the bottom-nav Add menu and never
mounts it, so a raw `shellContext` is **null** and tapping Categories/Tags would crash with
`Navigator.of(null)`. (`receipt_form.dart` uses the same helper for its quick-actions sheet.) Guarded
by `test/widgets/quick_scan_form_test.dart` (tap-opens-picker, shellContext null) and on-device by
`quick_scan_submit_test.dart`.

### `integration_test` is a regular dependency on purpose (Android Studio signed-bundle builds)

`integration_test` is listed under **`dependencies`**, not `dev_dependencies`, in `pubspec.yaml`.
This looks wrong and is deliberate — moving it back breaks release builds driven from Android
Studio's **"Generate Signed Bundle / APK"** wizard.

Why: **Flutter 3.27+ strips `dev_dependency` plugins from release builds.** But
`android/app/src/main/java/io/flutter/plugins/GeneratedPluginRegistrant.java` (generated, gitignored)
is rewritten by the **flutter tool**, and `flutter pub get` — which Android Studio runs on every
**project sync** — re-injects `IntegrationTestPlugin` into it. The wizard then invokes the Gradle
task **directly**, so nothing regenerates the registrant for release mode, and
`:app:compileReleaseJavaWithJavac` fails with:

```
GeneratedPluginRegistrant.java:44: error: package dev.flutter.plugins.integration_test does not exist
```

`flutter clean` does **not** fix it — the registrant lives in `src/main/java`, not `build/`. The
failure is deterministic, not flaky: every Studio sync re-poisons the file. `flutter build
apk|appbundle --release` always works, because the flutter tool regenerates the registrant with dev
plugins stripped — which is why the CLI and the wizard disagree.

Keeping `integration_test` as a normal dependency restores the pre-3.27 behavior (the plugin stays on
the release classpath, so the reference compiles) and costs roughly **+0.6MB** of bundle plus an
inert `IntegrationTestPlugin` registration in production. The alternative — dropping the wizard for
`flutter build appbundle --release` with a real `signingConfigs.release` in `android/app/build.gradle`
— is the cleaner long-term fix but requires wiring up keystore signing, which the repo currently does
**not** have (release is pinned to `signingConfig signingConfigs.debug`; the wizard supplies signing).

### Android Gradle: cunning_document_scanner needs the Kotlin plugin + Kotlin 2.2.x

`cunning_document_scanner` **2.3.0** modernized its `android/build.gradle` to the
`kotlin { compilerOptions { ... } }` DSL but (a) **does not apply the Kotlin Gradle plugin
itself** and (b) requires **Kotlin 2.2.x** for that extension-level `compilerOptions` block.
This app historically applied `kotlin-android` only to `:app` and pinned Kotlin **2.1.0**, so a
clean Android build failed at the Gradle **configuration** step — first
`Could not find method kotlin()` then `Could not find method compilerOptions() ... on
KotlinAndroidProjectExtension` — for **every** build, blocking the whole Android e2e suite.

The fix (all in `mobile/android/`, committed app config — not generated):

- **`build.gradle` (root):** a `subprojects { sp -> sp.plugins.withId('com.android.library')
  { sp.apply plugin: 'org.jetbrains.kotlin.android' } }` block applies `kotlin-android` to any
  Android-library plugin subproject the moment it applies `com.android.library`, so the
  plugin's `kotlin {}` DSL resolves (re-applying an already-applied plugin is a no-op). The
  legacy `buildscript` Kotlin classpath was **removed** from this file — the version is now
  managed in `settings.gradle` (keeping it in both places triggers "plugin already on the
  classpath with an unknown version").
- **`settings.gradle`:** the `pluginManagement` `plugins {}` block declares
  `id "org.jetbrains.kotlin.android" version "2.2.21" apply false` (matching the modern Flutter
  template and the plugin's own example app). This is the lever that actually sets the Kotlin
  version the `kotlin-android` plugin resolves to — bumping the old `ext.kotlin_version` in the
  root `build.gradle` had **no effect**.

If a future dependency bump re-breaks the Android build with a Kotlin/AGP DSL error, the Kotlin
version to bump is in `settings.gradle`, not the root `build.gradle`. The simpler alternative
(if you don't need 2.3.0) is to pin `cunning_document_scanner: ^1.4.0`, whose `build.gradle`
applies `kotlin-android` itself and uses the legacy `kotlinOptions {}` DSL (works on Kotlin
2.1.0); its `getPictures(noOfPages:)` API — the only call the app uses (`lib/utils/scan.dart`) —
is identical.

**Related: `sentry_flutter` pins Kotlin `languageVersion 1.6`.** `sentry_flutter` **8.14.2**'s
`android/build.gradle` hardcodes `kotlinOptions { languageVersion = "1.6" }`, which the project's
Kotlin **2.2.x** toolchain (above) rejects at compile time — `flutter build apk --release` fails at
`:sentry_flutter:compileReleaseKotlin` with *"Language version 1.6 is no longer supported; please,
use version 1.8 or greater"*. iOS uses a different toolchain and never hits this. The fix (root
`android/build.gradle`) is a `subprojects { if (sp.name == 'sentry_flutter') { sp.afterEvaluate {
tasks.withType(KotlinCompile).configureEach { compilerOptions { languageVersion / apiVersion .set(
KOTLIN_1_8) } } } } }` block — scoped to that one module (via `afterEvaluate` so it overrides the
module's own `kotlinOptions`), so every other subproject keeps its own language version. The block
is a no-op / removable once `sentry_flutter` is upgraded past the 1.6 pin (9.x drops it, but 9.x
needs a newer Dart SDK than this app currently targets).

### Crash & error reporting (GlitchTip) + the iOS launch-freeze fix

**Crash reporting** is via `sentry_flutter` → a self-hosted **GlitchTip** (Sentry-compatible)
backend, wired in `lib/service/crash_reporting.dart`. It is **opt-out (on by default)** and
**privacy-hardened**: `sendDefaultPii=false`, no screenshots / view-hierarchy / print breadcrumbs,
`tracesSampleRate=0`, `enableAutoSessionTracking=false` (GlitchTip has no sessions), no `setUser`.
`main()` only calls `SentryFlutter.init` when `isCrashReportingEnabled()` (a `SharedPreferences`
flag, default true); the **opt-out toggle** ("Crash & error reporting") lives in
`UserProfileScreen` and flips it live via `setCrashReportingEnabled` (`SentryFlutter.init` /
`Sentry.close()`). The app has **zero** other analytics/tracking SDKs. `sentry_flutter` is pinned at
**8.14.2** (9.x needs a newer Dart SDK); its Android Kotlin pin needs the gradle override documented
above.

**iOS launch-freeze fix (GitHub #617).** On iOS the Flutter engine pauses rendering while the app is
`inactive`, and on **iOS 26.x with 120Hz ProMotion displays** (iPhone 17 / Air) it doesn't reliably
resume — the first frame is painted at transient launch window metrics (wrong size/orientation) and
then never repaints, so the UI freezes "half-rotated / unpainted." The fix (`lib/main.dart`):
- **No launch-time permission request.** The old fire-and-forget `requestPermissions()` in
  `initState` popped a camera dialog (→ `inactive` → freeze) *and* collided with in-context requests.
  Camera is now requested by the scanner itself; photo-library access is requested at the
  `Gal.putImageBytes` save sites (`receipt_app_bar_action_builder.dart`,
  `receipt_image_app_bar.dart`). `requestPermissions()` is kept (uncalled) because a unit test
  covers it.
- **A forced-frame pump** (`nudgeFrames()`): bumps an invisible `ValueNotifier` (hosted in
  `MaterialApp.builder`) **and** calls `WidgetsBinding.instance.scheduleForcedFrame()` each tick for
  ~3s — the forced call bypasses the engine's "frames disabled while inactive" gate. It fires from
  three points: a **launch** `addPostFrameCallback` (cold launch delivers no `resumed`), on
  **`didChangeMetrics`** while a 6s launch window is open (re-flows the stale frame the moment the
  window geometry settles), and on lifecycle **`resumed`** (app-switcher / scan-camera returns). It
  **early-returns unless `defaultTargetPlatform == TargetPlatform.iOS`**, so Android/desktop and the
  test suites are unaffected.

### QR-scan the server URL (login)

The "Connect to Server" screen (`lib/auth/set-homeserver-url/screens/set_homeserver_url.dart`, route
`/`) has a `qr_code_scanner` suffix-icon button on the URL field. **The server-URL field lives here,
not on the `/login` username/password screen** — `/login` only *shows* the already-set base path.
The button opens a full-screen scanner (`qr_scanner_screen.dart`) built on **`mobile_scanner`**
(`^7.2.0`, QR-only via `formats: [BarcodeFormat.qrCode]`), which pops the raw decoded string back.
The scanner draws a centered **targeting box** (dimmed scrim + four L-shaped corner brackets + a hint
line, via a small private `_CornerBracketPainter`) as a **visual aim guide only** — detection runs on
the **whole camera frame**. We deliberately do **not** use `MobileScanner.scanWindow` to gate
detection: it made scanning intermittent (a QR visibly inside the box would scan only sometimes).
Per mobile_scanner's own changelog the scan-window intersection test is unreliable — Android accuracy
was only just improved in 7.2.0 ("migrated boundingBox to cornerPoints") and 7.x lists "[Apple] scan
window does not work correctly" as a known issue — so whole-frame detection is the reliable choice.
The box Rect is computed inside the `overlayBuilder` from its `constraints` (the scanner sits below an
AppBar, where `MediaQuery.sizeOf` would misalign the box).
The screen validates the decoded string with `normalizeServerUrl` (`lib/utils/url.dart` — trim + require a well-formed
http/https URL with a non-empty host; **http is allowed** for LAN/self-hosted instances) and, on
success, `patchValue`s the `url` form field. It **never auto-connects** — the user reviews the
populated URL and taps Connect (phishing mitigation: a malicious QR can't silently point the app at
an attacker's server that would then harvest credentials). Invalid content shows an error snackbar and
leaves the field untouched.

Native / platform notes:
- **iOS: no deployment-target change.** mobile_scanner 7.x uses Apple's **Vision framework** on
  iOS/macOS (not GoogleMLKit — see its issue #1225), and its pod declares
  `s.ios.deployment_target = '12.0'`, so the repo's existing **13.0** is fine. Verified:
  `flutter build ios --simulator --no-codesign` builds clean at 13.0 (an earlier plan to bump to 15.5
  for a supposed GoogleMLKit requirement was wrong and was reverted — no iOS device support dropped).
  `NSCameraUsageDescription` already existed (shared with `cunning_document_scanner`); only its wording
  was broadened to mention QR scanning. After pulling this change, iOS needs `cd ios && pod install`.
- **Android** needs no gradle/manifest change: `CAMERA` is already declared and the inherited
  `flutter.minSdkVersion` (24) / `compileSdkVersion` (36) exceed mobile_scanner's floor (21 / 35). ML
  Kit is **bundled** by default; to shrink the APK set
  `dev.steenbakker.mobile_scanner.useUnbundled=true` in `android/gradle.properties` (needs Play
  Services).
- **`pubspec.yaml`** Dart SDK floor was raised `>=3.2.5` → `>=3.7.0` (mobile_scanner 7.2.0 requires it;
  the resolved toolchain is already 3.10+).
- **Permission double-request race:** the scanner `await`s the shared-in-flight `requestPermissions()`
  (`lib/utils/permissions.dart`) and uses `autoStart: false` before `controller.start()`, so it never
  races the app-init camera request (the `ERROR_ALREADY_REQUESTING_PERMISSIONS` case documented above
  for `cunning_document_scanner`).
- **Fallback states + recovery:** besides the live camera, `qr_scanner_screen.dart` renders three
  non-camera states via a shared `_buildMessage` helper — unsupported (Linux), **permission denied**
  ("Open Settings"), and **camera error** ("Retry"). `controller.start()` is wrapped in `_safeStart`
  (catches `MobileScannerException` → camera-error state; skips the start if already running). On
  `AppLifecycleState.resumed` the screen re-checks permission and clears the denied/error state if
  access was just granted (so "Open Settings" actually recovers). `_onDetect` is `!mounted`-guarded so
  a buffered detection can't pop a disposed context.
- **Linux / e2e + testing:** mobile_scanner has no Linux desktop implementation, so the screen guards
  on `Platform.isLinux` and renders the unsupported message instead of constructing `MobileScanner` —
  `run-e2e.sh` stays green. The controller is created **lazily** and the widget exposes small
  `@visibleForTesting` seams (`debugScannerSupported` / `debugForcePermissionDenied` /
  `debugForceCameraError`), so `test/widgets/qr_scanner_screen_test.dart` covers the three fallback
  states + the close button **without a camera or channel mocks**. Post-scan/validation logic is
  covered by `test/widgets/set_homeserver_url_test.dart` (injectable `scanQrCode` seam) and
  `test/utils/url_test.dart`. The live-camera path is exercised only on Android/iOS + manual runs.

### App Links / Universal Links — server-URL pre-fill (login)

The desktop login page shows a QR encoding a **deep link** to
`https://receiptwrangler.io/app/setup`, with the server URL carried in the **URL fragment** as
`#url=<percent-encoded server url>` (e.g.
`https://receiptwrangler.io/app/setup#url=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo.receiptwrangler.io%2Fapi`). Scanning it
(or tapping it on device) opens this app and **pre-fills** the "Server URL" field on the Connect-to-Server
screen (`/`, `SetHomeserverUrl`). The **same** link also works when scanned by the in-app QR scanner.
We deliberately **do not auto-connect** — the user reviews the URL and taps Connect (phishing
mitigation, matching the plain-QR path above).

- **Dependency:** `app_links` (`^6.4.1`) handles the links ourselves rather than letting go_router try
  (and fail) to route `/app/setup`. We intentionally do **not** set `flutter_deeplinking_enabled`.
  Pinned to the **6.x** line on purpose: `app_links` 7.x requires Dart `>=3.12.0`, but this app's
  `environment.sdk` floor is `>=3.7.0` (6.4.1 needs only `>=3.5.0`), and the 6.x API
  (`getInitialLink()` / `uriLinkStream`) is identical to 7.x. Bumping to 7.x would require raising the
  Dart floor — do that deliberately if/when the app moves to Flutter 3.44+.
- **Extractor** (`lib/utils/url.dart`): `extractDeepLinkServerUrl(String raw)` requires
  `host == receiptwrangler.io` and `path == /app/setup`, reads `Uri.splitQueryString(uri.fragment)['url']`,
  and passes that value back through the existing `normalizeServerUrl` gate (so http/https +
  non-empty-host validation is reused). Returns null for anything that isn't this deep link. Covered by
  `test/utils/url_test.dart`.
- **Deep-link handler** (`lib/main.dart`, `_ReceiptWrangler`): subscribes via `app_links` in `initState`
  — `getInitialLink()` for cold start (stashed immediately so it survives the `FutureBuilder` first-paint
  gate) and `uriLinkStream` for warm/resumed. For each URI it runs `extractDeepLinkServerUrl`; on a match
  it sets `AuthModel.pendingServerUrl` and routes to `/`. The stream subscription is cancelled in
  `dispose`. Both sources are **injectable for tests** — `buildApp({initialDeepLink, deepLinkStream})`
  → `ReceiptWrangler`, and `_initDeepLinks` falls back to the real plugin
  (`widget.initialDeepLink ?? await _appLinks.getInitialLink()`, `widget.deepLinkStream ??
  _appLinks.uriLinkStream`). `main()` passes neither. The seam exists because the e2e process runs **on**
  the device and can't ask the OS to open a URL; mocking `app_links`' private channels instead would
  couple the spec to plugin internals.
- **Pre-fill** (`AuthModel.pendingServerUrl` + `SetHomeserverUrl`): the handler stashes the URL on
  `AuthModel.pendingServerUrl` (a nullable field with `setPendingServerUrl` / `clearPendingServerUrl`,
  both `notifyListeners`). `SetHomeserverUrl` consumes it in `build`: when non-null it `patchValue`s the
  `url` field in a post-frame callback (the FormBuilder state isn't attached during the first build) and
  clears it. This covers both the **cold-start** case (value present when the widget first mounts) and
  the **warm** case (value arrives later → listener fires → rebuild). Covered by
  `test/widgets/set_homeserver_url_test.dart`.
- **In-app scanner reuse** (`set_homeserver_url.dart` `_onScanPressed`): resolves the scanned value with
  `extractDeepLinkServerUrl(raw) ?? normalizeServerUrl(raw)`, so the deep-link QR and a plain server-URL
  QR both fill the field.
- **Redirect interaction:** the existing `/`→`/groups` auth redirect
  (`guards/auth-guard.dart` `unprotectedRouteRedirect`) means the pre-fill only surfaces for
  **unauthenticated** sessions — a logged-in user is already set up, so bouncing them to `/groups` is
  intended. Do not try to defeat the redirect.
- **Native config:**
  - **Android** (`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`): a second `<intent-filter>` on
    `MainActivity` with `android:autoVerify="true"` (VIEW/DEFAULT/BROWSABLE) and
    `<data android:scheme="https" android:host="receiptwrangler.io" android:pathPrefix="/app/setup"/>`.
    App Links verify against the installed `applicationId` (`io.receiptwrangler`), so no namespace change
    is needed. No new permissions.
  - **iOS** (`ios/Runner/Runner.entitlements`): `com.apple.developer.associated-domains` =
    `[applinks:receiptwrangler.io]`, wired via `CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS = Runner/Runner.entitlements;` into
    **all three** Runner build configs in `project.pbxproj` — Debug, Release **and Profile** (not
    RunnerTests). Profile matters because `flutter run/build --profile` binaries would otherwise ship
    without the associated-domains entitlement and silently fail to verify Universal Links.
    Universal Links don't need an Info.plist change. Bundle id `io.receiptwrangler`, Apple Team ID
    `3VD3YNZ3KA` (already set).
  - The hosted `.well-known/assetlinks.json` / `apple-app-site-association` files live on the
    **receiptwrangler.io host** (nginx), not in this repo — nothing here can verify them, so a broken
    association shows up only on a real device.
- **E2E** (`integration_test/login_qr_deep_link_test.dart`): the cross-component contract test. It
  enables the login QR for the run's own backend (`enableLoginQrForTest` in
  `helpers/login_qr_fixtures.dart` — a **global** system-settings mutation, restored on teardown), reads
  the **real** `loginQrUrl` the Go API composed off the unauthenticated `GET /featureConfig`, and feeds
  that exact string to the app through the `buildApp` seam. Three cases: cold start (prefill → assert the
  Go-escaped fragment round-trips to the exact server URL → **no auto-connect** → Connect → log in →
  `GroupSelect`), warm stream delivery, and wrong-host / wrong-path links being ignored (with a positive
  control so a dead subscription can't fake the pass). Go tests and the Dart unit tests each assert
  against their own hardcoded strings — this spec is the only thing pinning the two together. The deep-link
  stream fixture is a **single-subscription** `StreamController` on purpose: it buffers events until
  `_initDeepLinks` attaches its listener (which happens after an `await`), where a broadcast controller
  would silently drop them.

### Testing

Run tests with `flutter test`. Run a single file with `flutter test test/path/to/file_test.dart`.

**All new code must have accompanying tests.** When adding a new widget, utility, model, or service, add a corresponding test in `test/` that exercises:
- The happy path
- Sign / boundary cases (negative, zero, empty) where applicable
- Wiring contracts (validators, keyboard types, transformers) that downstream code depends on

Existing reference tests:
- `test/services/token_refresh_service_test.dart` — service unit tests with mocktail
- `test/widgets/amount_field_test.dart` — widget tests with FormBuilder + Provider
- `test/utils/currency_test.dart` — pure utility tests
- `test/helpers/widget_test_helpers.dart` — shared widget-test setup helpers
- `test/helpers/auth_test_helpers.dart` — shared mocks and JWT builders

#### Directory layout
Mirror the `lib/` tree: `test/widgets/` for widget tests of `lib/shared/widgets/...`, `test/utils/` for `lib/utils/...`, `test/services/` for `lib/service[s]/...`, `test/interceptors/` for interceptors. Shared helpers go in `test/helpers/`.

#### Flutter widget-test best practices

These patterns are followed by the existing tests; new tests should keep to them:

- **Use `testWidgets` (not `test`) for widget tests.** It supplies the `WidgetTester` and binds the framework.
- **Locate by `Key`, not by widget type.** Pass a `ValueKey` to the widget under test and use `find.byKey(...)`. When you need a specific descendant (e.g. the inner `FormBuilderTextField` of an `AmountField`), use `find.descendant(of: find.byKey(...), matching: find.byType(...))`. `find.byType(...)` alone breaks as soon as another instance lands in the tree.
- **Prefer `pump()` over `pumpAndSettle()`.** `pumpAndSettle` waits for *all* frames to drain and will time out against any continuous animation or formatting-on-change controller (e.g. `currency_textfield`). Reach for `pumpAndSettle` only when a specific test introduces an animation that has to flush.
- **Inject ChangeNotifier dependencies with `ChangeNotifierProvider`.** Use the `create:` constructor when the test owns the instance (auto-disposes); use `.value(value: existing)` only when the test reuses a model created elsewhere.
- **Prefer real model instances over mocks** when the model has no I/O and reasonable defaults (e.g. `SystemSettingsModel`). Mocking via mocktail is for models with I/O or where you need to verify interactions.
- **Only call `registerFallbackValue` when stubs use `any()` matchers.** Concrete `when(() => mock.x()).thenReturn(...)` does not need fallback registration.
- **Don't `tester.enterText` against `currency_textfield` (or any input with a controller that intercepts/reformats keystrokes).** It's fragile across package versions. Test the read path via `initialAmount` round-tripped through `valueTransformer`, and test the write path by inspecting the widget's `keyboardType`.
- **Register the custom currency in `setUpAll`** before any test that calls `exchangeCustomToUSD` / `exchangeUSDToCustom`. The shared helper `registerCustomCurrencyForTests()` in `test/helpers/widget_test_helpers.dart` is idempotent — call it once per test file.
- **Skip golden tests** unless the component is visually critical and the team is set up to maintain reference images.

#### Workflow

1. Write the test alongside the change.
2. `flutter analyze` — must be clean on the new files (the codebase has pre-existing warnings; only check the files you touched).
3. `flutter test` — must be all green.
4. If a test surfaces a real production bug (it happens — e.g. `Money.parse` of a leading `-` against the USD pattern), fix the bug as part of the same change rather than skipping the test.

### E2E Testing

End-to-end tests live in `integration_test/` (sibling of `test/`) and use Flutter's first-party **`integration_test`** package. They drive the real app against a running Go API, mirroring the desktop Playwright suite under `desktop/e2e/`.

**Stack choice:** `integration_test` SDK package. Not Patrol (we don't need native permission dialogs yet). Not the deprecated `flutter_driver`.

**Supported targets:**
- **Local Android emulator** via `./run-e2e-android.sh` (macOS, auto-boots an AVD).
- **Local iOS Simulator** via `./run-e2e-ios.sh` (macOS, auto-boots a sim).
- **Local Linux desktop** via `./run-e2e.sh` (containers/CI Linux). Originally the primary target; kept for the dev container's headless flow.
- **CI Android + iOS** via `.github/workflows/mobile-e2e.yml`, currently **advisory** (`continue-on-error: true`). Triggers: `push` to `main` (post-merge), `push` to `tech/mobile-e2e` (iteration on the e2e setup itself), and `workflow_dispatch`. If `secrets.E2E_BASE_URL` is unset, both jobs are skipped (forks without demo credentials). The formerly skipped specs (`receipt_comments_test`, `receipt_cost_split_test`) are un-skipped and green — the product bugs they tracked are fixed — so nothing blocks flipping `continue-on-error` once CI demonstrates stability.

Screenshot/video capture on failure is still deferred — see the "Out of scope" note at the bottom of this section.

#### Prerequisites

**Per target:**

| Target          | Prereqs                                                                                                              |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Android (mac)   | Android SDK (Studio or `cmdline-tools`); at least one AVD; `coreutils` on PATH (`brew install coreutils`, for `gtimeout`). |
| iOS (mac)       | Xcode + iOS Simulator (`xcrun simctl` on PATH); `coreutils` on PATH. The iOS Simulator runtime matching your installed Xcode is required — see "iOS 26.x runtime gotcha" below. |
| Linux desktop   | `apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends libsecret-1-dev xvfb` (`libsecret-1-dev` to *build* `flutter_secure_storage_linux`, `xvfb` to *run* headlessly — `run-e2e.sh` auto-wraps in `xvfb-run` when `$DISPLAY` is unset). Plus `flutter config --enable-linux-desktop`. |

**Shared, one-time:**

1. `cd mobile && flutter pub get`
2. Seed the two e2e users by running `./api/dev/seed-e2e-users.sh` (idempotent — safe to re-run). It logs in as the default `admin/admin` user that `MakeMigrations()` auto-creates on a fresh DB, then calls the admin-protected `POST /user/` to create:
   - `e2e-admin` with role `ADMIN`
   - `e2e-user` with role `USER`

   The script uses creds matching `api/dev/switch-to-sqlite.sh` (and the mariadb/postgresql variants), so a later `source` of those scripts gives the runners credentials that line up with what's seeded. Override `ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` if the default admin's password has been changed; override `API_BASE_URL` to seed a non-local backend.

   Why API-seed instead of the UI: `enableLocalSignUp` is `false` locally so the UI signup 404s, and even if enabled, the auto-`admin/admin` already holds the "first user = ADMIN" slot — a subsequent UI signup for `e2e-admin` would land as USER. `POST /user/` requires admin auth but accepts an explicit `userRole`, so it bypasses both gotchas.

**Every run:** start the Go API separately (`cd api && go run main.go`). None of the runners start the API — same pattern as Playwright.

#### Running locally

Three runners, one per target. Each accepts optional spec paths; with no args it iterates every `*_test.dart` under `integration_test/`.

```bash
# Android emulator (mac dev primary target):
cd mobile && ./run-e2e-android.sh
cd mobile && ./run-e2e-android.sh integration_test/smoke_login_test.dart

# iOS Simulator:
cd mobile && ./run-e2e-ios.sh
cd mobile && ./run-e2e-ios.sh integration_test/smoke_login_test.dart

# Linux desktop (containers, CI Linux):
cd mobile && ./run-e2e.sh
```

All three runners source `api/dev/switch-to-sqlite.sh` for the four `E2E_*` credentials, write a temp dart-define JSON, and invoke flutter against the suite. **What differs:**

| Runner             | Target          | Invocation                       | Default `E2E_BASE_URL`           |
| ------------------ | --------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `run-e2e-android.sh` | Android emulator | `flutter drive` (one per spec) | `http://10.0.2.2:8081/api` (host loopback alias) |
| `run-e2e-ios.sh`   | iOS Simulator   | `flutter drive` (one per spec)   | `http://localhost:8081/api`      |
| `run-e2e.sh`       | Linux desktop   | `flutter test` (one per spec)    | `http://localhost:8081/api`      |

**Mobile-runner-specific env overrides:**
- `E2E_ANDROID_AVD` — AVD name (default `Pixel_3a_API_34_extension_level_7_arm64-v8a`). Auto-booted with `-no-snapshot-save -no-boot-anim` if no emulator is attached; the script waits for `sys.boot_completed=1` (5 min ceiling).
- `E2E_IOS_DEVICE` — simulator device name (default `iPhone 15`). Auto-booted via `xcrun simctl boot` + `bootstatus`. The grep anchor (`^ *<name> (`) excludes "iPhone 15 Pro" / "Pro Max" siblings, so set the exact name.
- `E2E_MOBILE_BASE_URL` — overrides the table defaults. Useful for pointing at a remote backend, e.g. `E2E_MOBILE_BASE_URL=https://demo.receiptwrangler.io/api ./run-e2e-android.sh`.

**Why `flutter drive` on mobile, `flutter test` on Linux:** on the Android/iOS path, `flutter test integration_test/...` repeatedly hit "Integration tests and unit tests cannot be run in a single invocation" even on a single file. Every working android-emulator-runner CI example uses `flutter drive` with an explicit driver + target (`test_driver/integration_test.dart` calls `integrationDriver()`), so we follow that pattern on mobile. Linux desktop works fine with `flutter test`.

**Why one-`flutter drive`-per-spec on mobile:** the top-level `GoRouter` in `lib/main.dart` is a final global — its location persists across `testWidgets` calls within the same flutter process. Spec N+1 inherits spec N's last URL and 403s on bootstrap. Looping one `flutter drive` per spec gives each its own process. Between specs, the mobile scripts force-stop and uninstall by bundle id `io.receiptwrangler` (flutter drive's own cleanup uninstalls by the namespace `com.example.receipt_wrangler_mobile`, which doesn't match the real package), `pkill -f dartvm` to free leaked dart isolate hosts that own the vmservice port, and wrap each spec in `gtimeout 600` so a hung run doesn't eat the whole job.

**Auto-discovery:** the mobile scripts walk a small list of candidate Flutter install dirs (`~/Documents/flutter/bin`, `~/flutter/bin`, `/opt/flutter/bin`, `/usr/local/flutter/bin`) if `flutter` is not on `$PATH`, and resolve the Android SDK from `$ANDROID_HOME` → `$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` → `~/Library/Android/sdk`. They prepend `platform-tools` and `emulator` to PATH for the run.

**Devices are left running on exit.** The scripts don't shut down the emulator/simulator — reruns reuse the booted device for speed. To force a cold boot next time: `adb emu kill` (Android) or `xcrun simctl shutdown <udid>` (iOS).

#### How env vars reach the tests

`String.fromEnvironment` is a `const` constructor — the **key has to be a literal**, so you cannot build it dynamically per role. `integration_test/helpers/env.dart` declares all five `E2E_*` reads as `static const` fields and exposes `E2eEnv.assertAdmin()` / `assertUser()` to fail fast when vars are unset.

**Never use `Platform.environment`** — it returns an empty map on Android/iOS. `--dart-define` is the only portable mechanism.

**Base URL gotcha:** the desktop suite's `E2E_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4200` points at the Angular dev server, whose proxy forwards `/api` to the Go backend. The mobile app has no proxy — it hits the API directly. `run-e2e.sh` therefore reads `E2E_MOBILE_BASE_URL` (defaults to `http://localhost:8081/api`) and maps it into the `E2E_BASE_URL` dart-define the test sees. Override for remote targets: `E2E_MOBILE_BASE_URL=https://demo.receiptwrangler.io/api ./run-e2e.sh`.

#### Writing tests

- **Bootstrap:** call `await tester.pumpWidget(buildApp())` (imported as `import 'package:receipt_wrangler_mobile/main.dart' show buildApp;`). `buildApp()` returns a fresh `MultiProvider` + `ReceiptWrangler` widget tree, with a per-`State` `late final GoRouter` so router location does not leak across `testWidgets`. Do NOT call `app.main()` from a test — `main()` triggers `runApp()` and `FlutterNativeSplash.preserve`, which conflicts with the test binding.
- **`IntegrationTestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()`** at the top of `main()` in every spec file. Required — `testWidgets` without it runs as a unit test and fails to reach native channels.
- **Gate `installLinuxDesktopMocks()` on `Platform.isLinux`** (from `integration_test/helpers/platform_mocks.dart`), right after the binding. It stubs three mobile-only plugins whose method channels are unimplemented on Linux desktop and would otherwise throw `MissingPluginException` during app bootstrap:
  - `permission_handler` (channel `flutter.baseflow.com/permissions/methods`) — camera permission request in `lib/utils/permissions.dart`.
  - `gal` (channel `gal`) — image-gallery access in the same helper.
  - `flutter_secure_storage` (channel `plugins.it_nomads.com/flutter_secure_storage`) — backed by an in-memory map; real libsecret would need an unlocked gnome-keyring + dbus session, which is fragile in containers/CI.

  On Android/iOS these plugins have real native implementations and must be hit directly, so the `if (Platform.isLinux) { installLinuxDesktopMocks(); }` gate in `smoke_login_test.dart` is the template — copy it into every new spec.
- **Never use `pumpAndSettle` on the bootstrap frame.** `main.dart` renders a `CircularProgressIndicator` inside a `FutureBuilder` during auth init; the indicator's animation means `pumpAndSettle` never returns. Use `pumpUntilFound` (from `integration_test/helpers/pump.dart`) instead — it polls until a target finder hits, with a timeout.
- **Locators:**
  - `FormBuilderTextField` has no Key; match by its `name` field:
    ```dart
    find.byWidgetPredicate((w) => w is FormBuilderTextField && w.name == 'username')
    ```
  - `CupertinoButton.filled` with a `Text` child is `find.widgetWithText(CupertinoButton, 'Log In')`.
- **Assert navigation by widget presence**, not URL. After login, `pumpUntilFound(find.byType(GroupSelect))` is stronger than reading the go_router state — the widget is present iff the `/groups` shell has mounted.
- **Each test cold-boots.** There is no Flutter equivalent of Playwright's `storageState`. When the suite grows past a handful of specs, either accept the per-test login cost or introduce a non-UI setup step. Don't hand-write state sharing between tests.

#### Caveats / things that will bite

- **Three tap-flake patterns** (each cost a debugging session on the Android emulator; recognize them by a
  "derived an Offset ... that would not hit test on the specified widget" warning followed by a downstream timeout).
  iOS makes pattern 2 **deterministic** where Android only flaked — Cupertino page/popup transitions are slower
  (~400ms), so any tap site without the hitTestable-wait + drain fails every run on the simulator:
  1. **`tester.ensureVisible` does not pump.** It jumps the scroll position but the widget's global offset only
     updates after a relayout, so an immediate `tap()` computes the stale (off-screen) center. Always
     `await tester.pump(...)` (or `pumpAndSettle`) between `ensureVisible` and `tap`.
  2. **Modal sheets and popup menus mount content on the animation's first frame.** `pumpUntilFound(find.text(...))`
     returns while the sheet is still sliding in / the popup is still scaling, and the tap lands where the item
     *was*. Wait on `finder.hitTestable()` and then drain a few frames (`for (...) pump(100ms)`) before tapping —
     see `addManualReceiptViaUI` and `receipt_cost_split_test._navigateToEdit` for the canonical shape.
  3. **Snackbars absorb taps on bottom-of-screen buttons.** The root ScaffoldMessenger renders snackbars ABOVE
     modal bottom sheets, so e.g. "Receipt added successfully" covers a sheet's bottom submit button for ~4s.
     `pumpUntilFound(tester, button.hitTestable())` resumes exactly when the snackbar departs.
- **Destination markers must be unique to the destination.** `find.text('Name')` matches on BOTH `/view` and
  `/edit` receipt forms, so it cannot prove an Edit navigation happened — use `find.byType(BottomSubmitButton)`
  (only mounted on edit/add paths) instead.
- **Quick Scan image input on Linux:** the sheet's gallery-upload icon (`getGalleryImages` in `lib/utils/scan.dart`) throws `"Unsupported platform"` on desktop via a `Platform.operatingSystem` switch **before** it reaches `file_selector`, so the file-selector mock can't help and `quick_scan_test.dart` (the gallery happy-path) is `skip: Platform.isLinux`. To reach the Quick Scan form headlessly, feed an image through the **document-scanner** icon (`Icons.add_a_photo`) with `installDocumentScannerMock()`, which works on **all** targets (Linux/iOS/Android).
- **Document-scanner mock must grant camera permission on every platform:** `CunningDocumentScanner.getPictures` requests `Permission.camera` **itself** (Dart-side, via `permission_handler`) before invoking its native channel, so `installDocumentScannerMock()` also calls `installCameraGalleryPermissionMocks()` (extracted from `installLinuxDesktopMocks`) on **all** platforms — not just Linux. Without it, iOS/Android hit the real permission_handler: the fire-and-forget `requestPermissions()` in `main.dart` leaves an app-init camera request **pending** (its native dialog is never dismissed in a headless test), and `getPictures`' own camera request then collides with it → `PlatformException(ERROR_ALREADY_REQUESTING_PERMISSIONS)`. Granting up front makes both requests resolve instantly with no dialog. Only this scan path needs the mobile grant; every other spec hits permission_handler natively (one fire-and-forget request, never a second) and stays green. `flutter_secure_storage` stays **real** on iOS/Android (only Linux mocks it).
- **Linux build linker/ar:** the desktop build resolves its toolchain from the installed clang's dir (e.g. `/usr/lib/llvm-19/bin`). With only `clang` installed you get `Failed to find any of [ld.lld, ld]` then `[llvm-ar, ar]` — install `lld` **and** the matching `llvm` package (see the Flutter SDK Setup apt line above) so `ld.lld` / `llvm-ar` land in that dir.
- **Headless display:** Flutter Linux desktop apps render through GTK and exit immediately without a display. `run-e2e.sh` auto-wraps in `xvfb-run` when `$DISPLAY` is unset. If you see "The log reader stopped unexpectedly, or never started," your display setup isn't working — check `xvfb-run --help` or set `DISPLAY` to a real X server.
- **`libsecret-1-dev` at build time:** the `flutter_secure_storage_linux` plugin's CMakeLists.txt does a `pkg_check_modules(libsecret-1>=0.18.4)` — if the dev headers aren't installed, the build fails with "The following required packages were not found: libsecret-1". Installed as a prereq above.
- **`libsecret` at runtime is avoided via mocks.** We don't bring up gnome-keyring + dbus for tests. `installLinuxDesktopMocks()` intercepts the platform channel with an in-memory map. If you ever want to exercise the real storage path (e.g. to reproduce a token-persistence bug), start a dbus session + gnome-keyring-daemon before the test — but don't do that by default; it adds a lot of fragile state.
- **Go API rate-limiter:** login is rate-limited. Rerunning the same test in tight succession can 429 — give it a few seconds between runs. The desktop suite notes the same issue in `desktop/e2e/helpers/auth.ts`.
- **DB accumulation:** tests write real rows (sessions, refresh tokens). Fine for a smoke test; when specs start creating receipts/groups/etc., build per-test uniqueness (UUIDs) into the data, mirroring the Playwright conventions.
- **Never commit credentials or the generated JSON.** `.e2e-env.json` is gitignored as belt-and-suspenders — the script already uses `mktemp`.
- **iOS 26.x runtime gotcha:** Xcode 26.x ships with only its own SDK (e.g. Xcode 26.5 → iOS 26.5 SDK only). Until that exact-version *simulator runtime* is installed, `xcodebuild -showdestinations` returns **zero** eligible destinations for this project — no sim on any iOS version is buildable, even though older runtimes (17.x / 18.x) show up under `xcrun simctl list runtimes`. Symptom: `run-e2e-ios.sh` reports `Unable to find a destination matching the provided destination specifier: { id:<udid> }` for whatever sim it picks. Fix: `xcodebuild -downloadPlatform iOS` (about 8GB, ~10–15 min). Once installed, the older simulators become buildable too.

#### Reference files

- `integration_test/smoke_login_test.dart` — canonical smoke test.
- `integration_test/permission_add_menu_test.dart` / `permission_receipt_edit_test.dart` — permission-gating coverage (add-menu gate, edit-popup gate, swipe-to-edit gate) using per-spec provisioned users/groups. The add-menu spec also gates **"Quick Scan"** on `group.receipts.quick-scan` (flag on via `enableAiPoweredReceiptsForTest`, isolating the permission from the `aiPoweredReceipts` flag): a Legacy Editor **minus** quick-scan hides it while "Add Manual Receipt" stays; a full Legacy Editor shows it.
- `integration_test/permission_search_test.dart` — search bottom-nav destination gated on `app.receipts.search` (deny via a custom app role minus that permission; allow via a Legacy User).
- `integration_test/permission_dashboard_redirect_test.dart` — group dashboards route gated on `group.dashboards.read` (deny → redirected to the receipts list via a custom group role minus that permission; allow via a Legacy Viewer). Landing is told apart by `GroupReceiptsList` vs `GroupDashboardWrapper`.
- `integration_test/permission_comments_test.dart` — comment **deny** paths on the edit-state comment screen: `group.comments.create` hidden → no input; `group.comments.delete` hidden → swipe-to-delete disabled. Members are provisioned from the **Legacy Editor** baseline (holds `group.receipts.update`, needed to reach edit state) minus the permission under test, via `provisionGroupMemberWithoutPermission(..., baselineRole: 'Legacy Editor')`.
- `integration_test/permission_paid_by_visibility_test.dart` — group-role paid-by visibility: a member restricted to "their own receipts" (via `provisionPaidByOwnMember` → `createRole(..., includeOwnPaidReceipts: true)`) sees only their own receipt in the group list; the admin-paid receipt is filtered out server-side. Mirrors desktop `paid-by-visibility.spec.ts` (list axis).
- `integration_test/permission_receipt_category_visibility_test.dart` — non-admin sees the per-group **category and tag** catalogs in the receipt-form pickers (sourced from `groupCategories` / `groupTags`, not the admin-only flat lists).
- `integration_test/reports_list_test.dart` — the Reports **list** view: seeds a template via `createReportTemplate` and asserts the row renders (regression guard for the `aggFunc` omitempty deserialization fix), the "No reports found" empty state, and the avatar-menu gate (`app.reports.read`/`readAll` shown, Legacy User hidden). Uses `provisionUserWithAppPermissions` in `permission_fixtures.dart`.
- `integration_test/helpers/env.dart` — dart-define consumption + guards.
- `integration_test/helpers/pump.dart` — `pumpUntilFound` polling helper.
- `integration_test/helpers/platform_mocks.dart` — Linux-desktop platform-channel stubs for `permission_handler`, `gal`, `flutter_secure_storage`.
- `integration_test/login_qr_deep_link_test.dart` — the login-QR **deep link** end to end: reads the real `loginQrUrl` off `GET /featureConfig` and injects it via the `buildApp` seam. See "App Links / Universal Links" above.
- `integration_test/helpers/login.dart` / `api.dart` — UI + API login as admin, the shared e2e-user, or arbitrary credentials (`loginAs` / `apiLoginAs`). `login.dart` also exposes the two halves `loginAs` is built from — `resetPersistedAppState()` (wipe secure storage + `basePath` so the app boots to the Connect screen) and `loginFromLoginScreen()` (credentials + `GroupSelect` landing) — for specs that reach the login screen some other way. `api.dart` carries the shared `getSystemSettings` / `putSystemSettings` (the PUT is an **upsert**: patch a fetched object, never send a partial body).
- `integration_test/helpers/permission_fixtures.dart` — admin-API provisioning for permission specs. **`_settingsToCommand` carries a hardcoded key list** — a new `GroupReceiptSettings` flag must be added there or every persisted e2e config silently resets it to `false`. Also: fresh user + group with a chosen system group role ("Legacy Viewer"/"Legacy Editor"), optional seeded receipt, `addTearDown` cleanup. Also mints **custom roles** for negative specs: `createRole`/`deleteRole`, `rolePermissionsByName`, and the convenience `provisionUserWithoutAppPermission` / `provisionGroupMemberWithoutPermission` (build a role = a Legacy role **minus one permission**). The backend won't delete an assigned role, so the role-delete teardown is registered **before** the user/group ones — LIFO makes it run last, after the assignments are gone.
- `integration_test/helpers/feature_flags.dart` — `enableAiPoweredReceiptsForTest()`: toggles the Quick Scan flag by pointing systemSettings at a junk receiptProcessingSettings record, restoring on teardown.
- `integration_test/helpers/login_qr_fixtures.dart` — `enableLoginQrForTest(serverUrl)`: flips the **global** `showLoginQr` / `mobileServerUrl` system settings, restores them on teardown (re-reads current settings rather than replaying a stale snapshot, like `feature_flags.dart`), and returns the backend-composed `loginQrUrl`. Plus `getLoginQrUrl()` — the unauthenticated `GET /featureConfig` read. **These are the same two settings the desktop suite's `login-qr.spec.ts` drives on the same shared backend** (both workflows read `secrets.E2E_BASE_URL`), so the `android-e2e` job and `e2e.yml`'s `e2e` job share a job-level concurrency group (`e2e-shared-backend`, `cancel-in-progress: false`) to keep the two suites from racing. The group is **ref-independent on purpose** — this workflow also fires on `tech/mobile-e2e` / `workflow_dispatch` while `e2e.yml` fires only on `main`, so a `${{ github.ref }}`-scoped group would separate them and defeat the lock; keep both groups byte-identical. `ios-e2e` doesn't need it — it doesn't run this spec.
- `integration_test/quick_scan_config_response_test.dart` — the Quick Scan per-image **form** shows/hides/requires fields per the selected group's `GroupReceiptSettings.quickScan*`, **without hitting the backend** (visibility assertions + client-side required-empty blocking, which short-circuits before the API call). Green on **all** targets (Linux/iOS/Android): it feeds an image via the mocked document-scanner channel (not the desktop-blocked gallery path) and injects the group config by mutating the live `GroupModel` via Provider (the same technique `quick_scan_disabled_test` uses for the AI flag — deterministic, no reliance on the local API persisting the fields). Six `testWidgets`: (1) single-group visibility + a categories-required fix-error snackbar; (2) **group switch** — two groups with opposite configs, asserts the field set **flips** when the dropdown changes; (3)+(4) **paid-by** / **tags** required+empty each block submit; (5) a required **comment** blocks submit; (6) `hideComments` hides the comment field even when the quick-scan toggle enables and requires it. Shared actions live in `helpers/quick_scan_actions.dart`. **Client injection only works for these no-backend tests** — successful submits must persist the config (see the submit spec). When injecting a synthetic group for a dropdown assertion, **trim `GroupModel.groups` to the all-group placeholder(s) + your target group(s)** (`keepOnlyGroup`) — the seeded admin accumulates many groups and an appended entry lands below the dropdown menu's viewport, where `find.text` can't reach it (a Material dropdown's scrollable doesn't build off-screen items into the element tree).
- `integration_test/quick_scan_submit_test.dart` — Quick Scan **submit** outcomes that actually POST to the API. The backend's `resolveQuickScanFields` validates against the group's **persisted** config, so these tests **persist** the config via `PUT /group/{id}/groupReceiptSettings` (`setGroupQuickScanConfig`, restored on teardown) instead of client-injecting — client (via AppData at login) and server then agree, as in production. Three `testWidgets`, all keeping paid-by/status **required** (making them optional needs a persisted default the backend enforces): (1) required paid-by+status filled + an **optional** category left empty still queues; (2) a **required** category **selected via the picker** queues — this is the on-device regression guard for the shellContext crash fix (see caveat below); (3) a **required comment** blocks submit while empty and queues once typed, which is the end-to-end proof the client sends the aligned `comments` array (an omitted or misaligned one would 400 against the persisted config). Uses `firstNonAllGroup` + `keepOnlyGroup`, seeds the category via `createCategory`, and drives the multi-select via the filter field + `ChoiceChip` (mirroring `receipt_cost_split_test`).
- `integration_test/quick_scan_prefill_test.dart` — Quick Scan per-image **prefill** from user preferences vs group config. Each added image seeds group/paid-by/status from `userPreferences.quickScanDefault*` (`_getInitialQuickScanValues`, delivered via AppData). Persists a group that **hides** paid-by (real prefs→AppData→form path via `setUserQuickScanPrefs` + `setGroupQuickScanConfig`, both restored) and asserts a **preset paid-by falls off** (field absent) while a **preset status is kept** (shown), then that submit **queues** (the hidden paid-by is backfilled from the group's `UPLOADER` default). Hiding paid-by/status in a persisted config **requires a group default** (`quickScanDefaultPaidByType: 'UPLOADER'` needs no id; `quickScanDefaultStatus` for status) — the backend rejects hiding/optional without one.
- `test/widgets/quick_scan_form_test.dart` — fast widget-level coverage of the same form logic: per-config visibility, paid-by/status required-vs-optional validators, null + non-null default configs, the group-switch behaviors (fields re-render per the new group's config; paid-by/categories/tags values clear on switch; a required validator is re-evaluated after switching), the picker tap-opens-with-null-shellContext crash guards, the **comment** cases (optional vs required validator, hidden by default / by `hideComments` / without `group.comments.create`, and surviving a group change), and **prefill vs config** (a prefilled paid-by/status shows when the group shows the field, and **falls off** — field absent — when the group hides it). Categories/tags "required" is **not** a field validator (enforced at submit in `quick_scan.dart`), so it's asserted in the integration spec, not here.
- `integration_test/helpers/document_scanner_mock.dart` — `installDocumentScannerMock()`: stubs the `cunning_document_scanner` channel's `getPictures` to return a fixed on-disk PNG **and** grants camera/gallery permission via `installCameraGalleryPermissionMocks()` on every platform (see the "Document-scanner mock" caveat above). This is the **only** way to add an image to the Quick Scan sheet on Linux desktop.
- `integration_test/helpers/platform_mocks.dart` — `installLinuxDesktopMocks()` (Linux-only: permission_handler + gal + flutter_secure_storage) and the extracted `installCameraGalleryPermissionMocks()` (camera + gallery grant, shared with the document-scanner mock on all platforms).
- `integration_test/helpers/receipt_test_helpers.dart` — `addManualReceiptViaUI` (group-selectable), URL/id extraction, receipt cleanup.
- `integration_test/helpers/nav.dart` — group-entry and group-receipt navigation helpers.
- `test_driver/integration_test.dart` — `integrationDriver()` entrypoint that `flutter drive` uses.
- `run-e2e-android.sh` — Android runner; auto-boots an AVD, runs per-spec `flutter drive` loop with cleanup between specs.
- `run-e2e-ios.sh` — iOS runner; resolves a simulator UDID by name and boots it, runs per-spec `flutter drive` loop.
- `run-e2e.sh` — Linux desktop runner; wraps in `xvfb-run` when headless, invokes `flutter test`.
- `.github/workflows/mobile-e2e.yml` — CI counterpart; same command shapes the local mobile scripts mirror.
- `desktop/e2e/helpers/auth.ts` — Playwright counterpart; follow its conventions when adding new flows.

#### Out of scope (future work)

- Flipping the workflow from advisory (`continue-on-error: true`) to required — unblocked now that every spec runs un-skipped; do it after CI demonstrates stability.
- Screenshot / video artifact capture on failure.
- `storageState`-style auth warmup across a multi-spec suite.
- Additional specs (receipt CRUD, group management, logout).
