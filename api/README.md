# Receipt Wrangler API

## Overview

Receipt Wrangler helps users manage and split receipts with features including:
- OCR-powered receipt scanning and processing
- AI-assisted receipt data extraction
- Email integration for automated receipt processing
- Multi-user support with flexible group management
- Receipt splitting and sharing capabilities

## Getting Started

Visit our [official documentation](https://receiptwrangler.io) for comprehensive setup and configuration instructions.

## Development

For development guidelines, configuration details, and API documentation, please refer to our [developer documentation](https://receiptwrangler.io/docs/category/development). Contributions welcome!

### Historical exchange rates

Foreign-currency receipts use the public Frankfurter API and the ECB provider by default. Operators can override the endpoint with `FX_PROVIDER_BASE_URL` (for example, to use a compatible internal proxy) and the Frankfurter provider identifier with `FX_RATE_PROVIDER`. Neither setting accepts or requires banking credentials.
